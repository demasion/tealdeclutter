I"™<p>Decluttering is never about making more space for your items.</p>

<p>Decluttering is the process whereby you decide whether the items in your space are actually clutter and if not, decide where they belong, and action that decision. The process will help you make a permanent change by enabling you to understand why you have clutter in the first place.</p>

<p>Hoarding Disorders UK has a helpful measure of clutter on their website. Their image scale can help people pick which picture in the sequence comes closest to the situation in rooms in their house e.g. their living room, kitchen and bedroom.</p>

<p>What is important to note is that clutter it is about how you feel in your space. Everyone has very different ideas about what for them constitutes a cluttered home. For some, a cluttered home can be when there is a chair in a room piled with clothes. For others, it can be when they realise they are having to create pathways through their stuff.</p>

<p>A common factor in people wanting to declutter is that they report feeling overwhelmed or ‚Äúsuffocated‚Äù by their space. Your home should be a place where you can breathe easily and the stress of the day falls off your shoulders as soon as you cross the threshold. Your office space should be somewhere you feel efficient, productive and in control (to the extent you can!).</p>
