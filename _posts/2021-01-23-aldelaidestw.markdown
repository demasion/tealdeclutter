This project was completed prior to a move-in. The client has requested for design ideas around adding additional closet space to his 2 bedroom apartment in DownTown Toronto.

With limited space to work with, we had to first figure out the measurements. Our service starts with a FREE consultation session, where we would walk through the living spaces with the client. This step ensures that the team gets clear understanding of what the client is struggling with and come up with the optimal solution.

*Kitchen*

Since the client moved into a 2 bedroom apartment from a 5 bedroom house, organizing everything in the kitchen was also a challenge. There are 3 major steps in a successful decluttering:

1. Identify what you must have
2. Identify the nice haves
3. Segregate the "not typically" used items
4. REPEAT!
