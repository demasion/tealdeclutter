Let's declutter the closet while the weather is nice!

You may ask, where do the clothes go after the decluttering❓

You can choose to either sell or donate❗️

<br/>

👉🏻Options if you would like to sell:

1️⃣Home garage sale (Garage Sale)

2️⃣ online platform sale (Kjiji/ Marketplace/ EBay)

3️⃣ Affordable thrift store sales (Common Sort/ Stile Encore/ Plato's Closet, etc.)

4️⃣ high-end thrift store consignment sales (Consignment Store, etc.)

<br/>

👉🏻If you would like to Recycle♻️ and Donate Your Clothes:

1️⃣H&M (get up to 15% off coupon for one item)

2️⃣Uniqlo Canada

3️⃣Major supermarkets/Plaza/Mall donation boxes

4️⃣Special donation object organizations (such as Dress for woman/ Covenant House/ Jessie's Centre/ Horizons For Young etc.)

🌟Whichever way you choose, Teal Declutter can assistant and guide you along the process. Please get in touch with us if you would like to know more 😊

👍🏻Here's a huge shout out to our customer from Oshawa, who did a great job of donating 4 large bags of clothes to Diabetes Canada.
