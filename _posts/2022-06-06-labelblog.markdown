The secret to sustainability and long-term maintenance: **Labeling!**

The key to keeping up a system isn't so much the containers you choose-albeit being critical-but the labeling. The labels, whether they're handwritten, typed, needlepointed, whatever, are really a set of instructions. Having labels will clearly and concretely identify the contents that belong in a container gives you, your kids, your partner, your housegusts, and anyone else using the space straightforward directions for where items go.

When items stay where they belong, you're successfully maintaining an organizational system. That's why it's imparative that you get the labeling right. It has to hit the sweet spot between the general and the specific, and it should be the perfect assortment of categories so that when you put away your groceries, laundry, or newest stash of crafting supplies, you barely have to think about it. What you want is a simple road map that's flexible enough to allow for the occassional outlier. What you *don't* want are overly specific containers that lock you in, so you find yourself sticking things anywhere because it's better than nowhere and then the system starts to fall apart and the sky opens up and all hell breaks loose and you're left with total anarchy.

Recommendation:
Think about your general categories *before* your specific ones. The general categories will be much larger groupings: for instance, "Breakfast" in a pantry. But if you notice you have a significant amount of oatmeal, you can create a specific category for just oatmeal. Or in a bathroom, you might have a large amount of hair products in general, but also a wide selection of just dry shampoos. In that case, you could have a general bin labeled "Hair Supplies" and another bin labeled and devoted exclusively to "Dry Shampoo".

What you want to avoid is having all specific bins, because inevitably you will buy something, bring it home, and have no idea where it goes. Our rule of thumb is to always lean toward general categories because you can't go wrong. More granular categories should be secondary.
